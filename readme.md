# PixoPython

This is a project that aims to serve as a general purpose API server/client that drives the 16x16 RGB LED matrix of the [pixopixel](https://github.com/IdleHandsProject/pixopixel), except implemented in [micropython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython)

## Getting Started:

1. Set up the [esp-IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git) tookchain according to the instructions for [micropython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/tree/master/ports/esp32). Ensure that you are able to get a python prompt.
2. Install Adafruit's [ampy](https://github.com/adafruit/ampy). This will be used to access the filesystem on the pixopixel.
3. `git clone https://github.com/alopexc0de/pixoPython.git`
